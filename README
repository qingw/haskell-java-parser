This is an implementation of a parser for Java 1.4 in
Haskell. A deal of work remains to be done to clean up the
results and present the parse tree in a useful form, but 
a large body of Java 1.4 code can be parsed successfully. 

The code depends only on the Parsec library for building 
Haskell recursive descent parsers.

== Use ==

* Run "make" to compile and run tests!

== Known Issues ==
* Comments cannot occur inside literals. For example:
  int i = 0x/*hello*/CAFEBABE;
* Unicode escapes are not supported (I have no immediate 
  plans to add support)

These issues are causing unit tests 196, 229, 252, 518, and
530 to fail.
