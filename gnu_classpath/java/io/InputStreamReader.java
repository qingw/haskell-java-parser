/**
 * This class reads characters from a byte input stream.   The characters
 * read are converted from bytes in the underlying stream by a 
 * decoding layer.  The decoding layer transforms bytes to chars according
 * to an encoding standard.  There are many available encodings to choose 
 * from.  The desired encoding can either be specified by name, or if no
 * encoding is selected, the system default encoding will be used.  The
 * system default encoding name is determined from the system property
 * <code>file.encoding</code>.  The only encodings that are guaranteed to 
 * be availalbe are "8859_1" (the Latin-1 character set) and "UTF8".
 * Unforunately, Java does not provide a mechanism for listing the
 * ecodings that are supported in a given implementation.
 * <p>
 * Here is a list of standard encoding names that may be available:
 * <p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>8859_1 (ISO-8859-1/Latin-1)</li>
 * <li>8859_2 (ISO-8859-2/Latin-2)</li>
 * <li>8859_3 (ISO-8859-3/Latin-3)</li>
 * <li>8859_4 (ISO-8859-4/Latin-4)</li>
 * <li>8859_5 (ISO-8859-5/Latin-5)</li>
 * <li>8859_6 (ISO-8859-6/Latin-6)</li>
 * <li>8859_7 (ISO-8859-7/Latin-7)</li>
 * <li>8859_8 (ISO-8859-8/Latin-8)</li>
 * <li>8859_9 (ISO-8859-9/Latin-9)</li>
 * <li>ASCII (7-bit ASCII)</li>
 * <li>UTF8 (UCS Transformation Format-8)</li>
 * <li>More later</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * It is recommended that applications do not use 
 * <code>InputStreamReader</code>'s
 * directly.  Rather, for efficiency purposes, an object of this class
 * should be wrapped by a <code>BufferedReader</code>.
 * <p>
 * Due to a deficiency the Java class library design, there is no standard
 * way for an application to install its own byte-character encoding.
 *
 * @see BufferedReader
 * @see InputStream
